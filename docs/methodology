# Methodology – H2 Permeation Sprint 1  

This project models 1-D hydrogen diffusion through a flat stainless steel wall.  
The goal is to create a simple, stable numerical simulation as the first step in a longer research path.  

### Approach
- Used Fick’s Second Law of diffusion.  
- Applied Sieverts’ law at the boundaries (high pressure → vacuum).  
- Implemented an explicit finite-difference scheme (FTCS).  
- Checked stability (r ≤ 0.5) and compared results with analytical steady state.  

### Why this matters
This basic setup allows me to see how hydrogen concentration evolves with depth and time.  
It also creates a foundation for adding more realistic conditions in future sprints.
