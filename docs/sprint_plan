# Sprint Plan – H2 Permeation Project  

The project is organized in steps (*sprints*), where each builds on the previous one.  

### Sprint 1 – Fundamentals ✅
- Built a 1D diffusion model in Python.  
- Produced concentration profiles and flux vs. time plots.  
- Gained experience in monitoring and interpreting diffusion behavior.  

### Sprint 2 – Operating Conditions (planned)  
- Add effects of temperature, pressure, and permeability activation energy.  
- Aim: move closer to conditions faced by PEMEL stacks.  

### Sprint 3 – Complex Systems (future)  
- Expand to more complex geometries and couple diffusion with electrochemical effects.  
- Aim: connect simulations more closely with experimental degradation studies.
