 Concentration Profile 

![Concentration Profile](results/concentration_profile.png) 

 This plot shows hydrogen concentration across the wall.  
 At the start (t=0s), the profile is flat. After ~43,000s, the curve settles into a straight line,  
 which is the expected steady-state diffusion gradient.
